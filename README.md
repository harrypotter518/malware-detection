# Malware Detection
1. SSH into the server and run the following commands.
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install clamav clamav-daemon -y
    sudo /etc/init.d/clamav-daemon enable
    ```
2. You can then check the status of clamav by replacing enable with status in the last command
3. Youâ€™ll then need to add the following to /etc/clamav/clamd.conf
    ```bash
    TCPSocket 3310 //you can use whatever port you want to use
    ```
4. Whitelist the port from the IP range (VPC in case of AWS) of your client machines
